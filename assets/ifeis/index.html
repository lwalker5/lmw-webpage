				<h2>What is iFeis?</h2>
				<p>Forget how you did at that feis last month? Want to know exactly how many top 10 placements you’ve had? Tired of forgetting your marks at home when you want to show your teacher?</p>

				<p>We’ve got a solution. iFeis is a way for you to keep track of your competitive irish dance journey.</p>

				<p>With iFeis you add feises you sign up for and when they happen you record your results and marks, add photos, and keep track of notes your might want to remember for later.</p>

				<p>Your profile will feature your feis stats, progress to your next level, and inspiration to keep you focused on your goals.

			<section id="what-is-not">
				<h2>What it is not.</h2>
				<p>A social network. Not everyone loves sharing everything and even if you want to there are already plenty of ways to do that. This is more like a diary. No one else needs to know if you have a bad day at the feis. It’s all part of your personal journey and you can learn by keeping track and making progress towards your goals.</p> 

				<p>Although there are some exceptions to sharing. We want you to show your teacher so they have a better idea of how you’re doing. They know a lot but even they may not remember how you did five feises ago.
